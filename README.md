# TypeScript + React Pomodoro Timer

[See it live](https://estevanmaito.me/pomodoro)

~~This is a complete rewrite of another project of mine, [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/estevanmaito/pomodoro-timer), writen using Vue.~~

This is a complete rewrite of another project of mine, [React Pomodoro](https://github.com/estevanmaito/react-pomodoro), writen using React.

Every time I learn a major new technology, I rewrite this app to practice. Unfortunately, I've lost the code for the original code, from 2013 (I think I didn't use Git back when I started), but you can still find the major Vue and React rewrites above.

The main differences between both projects are:

- Although still using React, now I'm using **TypeScript**.
- Instead of custom CSS with CSS Modules, now I'm using **Tailwind CSS**.
- I'm going for a retro, _Braun_-style, clock
