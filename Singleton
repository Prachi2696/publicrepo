## âœ… Singleton Design Pattern in Java (Interview Notes)

### ðŸ”¹ What is Singleton?

* A design pattern that ensures **only one instance** of a class is created.
* Provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why use Singleton?

* To save memory by preventing unnecessary object creation.
* Used for logging, config classes, DB connections, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:

* **Private constructor** to restrict instantiation.
* **Static variable** to hold the instance.
* **Public static method** to get the instance.

#### 5. **Bill Pugh Singleton (Best & Simplest Thread-safe)**

```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}
    private static class Holder {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return Holder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

âœ… Lazy, Thread-safe, No sync needed
âœ… Recommended way

### ðŸ”¹ Real-life Examples:

* Logger class
* Configuration manager
* Cache
* Thread pool
